# East Budleigh Hydrological Analysis

Workflow for the processing and analysis of hydrological data from East Budleigh EA gaug to evaluate the imapcts of Beaver on Flow regimes...

And here's the rough result...
![Bud Brook Location](7_Site_Location/exports/BudBrookLoc.jpg) 
Location of Budeligh brook catchemnt, gauging station and Beaver dam sequence.

![East Bud example1](6_Event_Stats/plots/Fig6.Q2Plus_glm.jpg)  
GLM showing peak flow attenuation for events with peak flow of magnitude greater than Q2  

![East Bud example2](6_Event_Stats/plots/Fig4.Excedence_Rain_Season.jpg)
GLM for all events showing change in peak flow exceedance limit across Hydrological season.

![East Bud example3](6_Event_Stats/plots/Fig5.QuantileReg.jpg)
Quantile regression for all events across different tau values - indicating greater attenuation at higher flows.
